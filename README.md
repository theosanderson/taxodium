# Taxodium

Taxodium is a client-side Javascript tool for exploring extremely large trees. It is currently used for Cov2Tree, a display of the global SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny: ðŸŒ³ http://cov2tree.org

The data and tree displayed in Cov2Tree are taken from the source collated UCSC and Angie Hinrichs: http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/wuhCor1/UShER_SARS-CoV-2// . And they represent the work of thousands of researchers across the world.

Most of this repository is a client side React app that displays the tree. It loads the `public/nodelist.pb` file, which contains a pre-processed form of the data. The Python scripts that build this file are in `data_processing`, along with a little documentation.
