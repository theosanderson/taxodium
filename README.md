# Taxodium

Taxodium is a client-side Javascript tool for exploring extremely large trees. It is currently used for Cov2Tree, a display of the global SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny. 

## Constructing your tree for the browser

Look at the `data_processing` directory. We construct two protobuffer files, `tree.pb` and `metadata.pb`.


## Development instructions
`nvm use 14`
`yarn install`
